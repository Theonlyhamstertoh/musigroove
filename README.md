# Musigroove
Musigroove is a easy and powerful way for dancers to add timestamps and labels for a better rehearsing experience. Choose any song you like to play from Youtube, add timestamps to any point of the song, and rewind/forward to those specific time instead of manually scrubbing to the position.
